Why IPMs are popular and what they are suitable for (Kéry and Schaub 2011; Plard et al. 2019). Overview over workflow, code repository &amp; contents of manual (Figure 0.1). Figure 0.1: Schematic representation of the SPI-IPM workflow. In no way complete: great if user’s analyses/adaptations become part. How to cite.
