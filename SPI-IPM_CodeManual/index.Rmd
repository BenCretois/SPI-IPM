# About this manual {-}

Briefly on the need for/value of standardized data and analyses.

Why IPMs are popular and what they are suitable for [@kery2011; @plard2019].

Overview over workflow, code repository & contents of manual (Figure \@ref(fig:WorkflowDiag)).

```{r WorkflowDiag, fig.cap='Schematic representation of the SPI-IPM workflow.', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('Figures/SPI-IPM_Workflow.png')
```

In no way complete: great if user’s analyses/adaptations become part.

How to cite.
