# Follow-up Analyses {#AddAnalyses}


##	Testing for time-trends


##	Testing for density-dependence


##	Investigating cross-population covariation


##	Quantifying demographic contributions to short term population dynamics

###	Year-by-year variation in population growth rate (random design LTRE)	 

###	Year-to-year differences in population growth rate (fixed design LTRE)


##	Quantifying demographic contributions to long-term population trends

###	Differences in population trajectories between time periods (period design LTRE)

###	Differences in population trajectories between locations (period design LTRE with time-by-space substitution)
